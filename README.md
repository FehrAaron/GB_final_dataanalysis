# GB_final_dataanalysis

This repository contains all code used for preprocessing and analysing data presented in the master thesis of Aaron Fehr. 

GB01&GB03_LiP-Quant.Rmd: script used to generate LiP-Quant plots and aggregate outputs from DRC script for LIP-Quant experiments (L1 = GB 01, L2&M1 = GB03)

GB02_TempLiP_DataAnalysis.Rmd: Script to analyse temporal experiment T1 (=GB02) after preprocessing and linear modelling

GB02_TempLiP_LinearModel.Rmd: Script to fit genearlised linear model to preprocessed data for T1

GB02_TempLiP_Preprocessing.Rmd: Script for preprocessing (filtering, summarisation to peptide level, QC, ...) for T1

LIP-Scoring GLobal analysis V3.2 MIT Licence modified.r: Script for DRC fitting of LiP-Quant experiments L1,L2 and M1. The script from "https://github.com/RolandBruderer/LiP-Quant" was slightly modified in order to bypass some bugs. Copyright (c) 2020 Roland Bruderer, Biognosys AG, Switzerland
